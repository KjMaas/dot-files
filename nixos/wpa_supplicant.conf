##### Example wpa_supplicant configuration file ###############################
#
# This file describes configuration file format and lists all available option.
# Please also take a look at simpler configuration examples in 'examples'
# subdirectory.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

# NOTE! This file may contain password information and should probably be made
# readable only by root user on multiuser systems.

# Note: All file paths in this configuration file should use full (absolute,
# not relative to working directory) path in order to allow working directory
# to be changed. This can happen if wpa_supplicant is run in the background.

# Whether to allow wpa_supplicant to update (overwrite) configuration
#
# This option can be used to allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration
# file whenever configuration is changed (e.g., new network block is added with
# wpa_cli or wpa_gui, or a password is changed). This is required for
# wpa_cli/wpa_gui to be able to store the configuration changes permanently.
# Please note that overwriting configuration file will remove the comments from
# it.
update_config=1

# For Windows Named Pipe: This value can be used to set the security descriptor
# for controlling access to the control interface. Security descriptor can be
# set using Security Descriptor String Format (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/
# library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/
# security_descriptor_string_format.asp). The descriptor string needs to be
# prefixed with SDDL=. For example, ctrl_interface=SDDL=D: would set an empty
# DACL (which will reject all connections). See README-Windows.txt for more
# information about SDDL string format.

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version
# wpa_supplicant is implemented based on IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 which defines
# EAPOL version 2. However, there are many APs that do not handle the new
# version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely). In order
# to make wpa_supplicant interoperate with these APs, the version number is set
# to 1 by default. This configuration value can be used to set it to the new
# version (2).
# Note: When using MACsec, eapol_version shall be set to 3, which is
# defined in IEEE Std 802.1X-2010.
eapol_version=1

# AP scanning/selection
# By default, wpa_supplicant requests driver to perform AP scanning and then
# uses the scan results to select a suitable AP. Another alternative is to
# allow the driver to take care of AP scanning and selection and use
# wpa_supplicant just to process EAPOL frames based on IEEE 802.11 association
# information from the driver.
# 1: wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection; if no APs matching to
#    the currently enabled networks are found, a new network (IBSS or AP mode
#    operation) may be initialized (if configured) (default)
# 0: This mode must only be used when using wired Ethernet drivers
#    (including MACsec).
# 2: like 0, but associate with APs using security policy and SSID (but not
#    BSSID); this can be used, e.g., with ndiswrapper and NDIS drivers to
#    enable operation with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; in this mode,
#    the network blocks in the configuration file are tried one by one until
#    the driver reports successful association; each network block should have
#    explicit security policy (i.e., only one option in the lists) for
#    key_mgmt, pairwise, group, proto variables
# Note: ap_scan=0/2 should not be used with the nl80211 driver interface (the
# current Linux interface). ap_scan=1 is the only option working with nl80211.
# For finding networks using hidden SSID, scan_ssid=1 in the network block can
# be used with nl80211.
# When using IBSS or AP mode, ap_scan=2 mode can force the new network to be
# created immediately regardless of scan results. ap_scan=1 mode will first try
# to scan for existing networks and only if no matches with the enabled
# networks are found, a new IBSS or AP mode network is created.
ap_scan=1

# EAP fast re-authentication
# By default, fast re-authentication is enabled for all EAP methods that
# support it. This variable can be used to disable fast re-authentication.
# Normally, there is no need to disable this.
